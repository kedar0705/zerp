**pooling**
A database connection pool is a cache of database connections that can be reused by multiple clients or threads.
Instead of opening and closing a new connection for each database operation, a connection pool maintains a set of open connections that can be borrowed and returned as needed.

**How It Works**
Initialization: A pool of connections is created and maintained.
Borrowing: When a client needs to perform a database operation, it borrows a connection from the pool.
Returning: After the operation is complete, the connection is returned to the pool for future use.
